  <section id="about" class="section-container">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m <strong>Babasanmi Adeyemi</strong>, but everyone calls me Jimi. I'm a dedicated Data Engineer with a passion for transforming raw data into strategic assets. 
      I specialize in designing and implementing <strong>scalable, robust data pipelines</strong> and cloud-native architectures that empower 
      organizations to make data-driven decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am interested in growing my knowledge in <strong>Data Engineering and Cloud Architecting</strong>. My interest has led me to grow my knowledge in Infrastructure as Code 
      using <strong>Terraform</strong>, <strong>CI/CD</strong> pipelines, <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>NoSQL</strong>, <strong>ETL</strong>, <strong>data modeling</strong>, 
      and <strong>data warehousing</strong>.
      I excel at automating complex ETL processes, optimizing data workflows, and ensuring secure, repeatable, high-performance deployments.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expertise lies in transforming vast, complex datasets into clear, actionable insights through <strong>engaging visualizations</strong> and 
      smart data management strategies. By leveraging cloud technologies and automation, I can help businesses unlock the full potential of their data, 
      driving operational excellence and business growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have hands-on experience with a variety of tools and technologies, and have worked with clients across diverse industries, including FCMG, Oil & Gas, Utilities, and Telecommunications.
      I’m always up for a new challenge and love learning new things, so feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or collaborate on a project!
      I am always eager to tackle new challenges and collaborate with talented teams to deliver innovative solutions that drive business success.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not coding or building data pipelines, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, chilling with friends, or enjoying a good book. 
      I’m also a big fan of music and love discovering new artists and tracks on Spotify.
